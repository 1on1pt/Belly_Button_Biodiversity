# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Creating an interactive data visualization for the web using Plotly.js, JavaScript, and HTML.

## Overview of the Project
Roza is a biological researcher who studies bacteria.  She hypothesizes that some species of bacteria synthesize protein that tastes like beef.  Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef to find the right bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.  Roza believes that bacteria found in the belly button might provide Improbable Beef with the right solution.  She would like to build a dashboard that her research participants and fellow researchers can access to see the results of the study.  Participants will be able to go to a website, select their participant idenfitification number from a drop down selector , and learn what bacteria species reside in their navel.

### Resources
**Code:**
* charts.js
* index.html

**Data:**
* samples.json

**Software:**
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* Chrome Developer Tools
* Visual Studio Code 1.65.1

## Results
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that includes a panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Roza's volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Here is the drop down selector that a participant would use to find a summary of their demographic information and research results:

Three visualizations to display reseach results were created:
1. Bar Chart
2. Bubble Chart
3. Gauge Chart

### Bar Chart
The bar chart displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found (in descending order) and a hover over a specific bar will display the species of bacteria found.
